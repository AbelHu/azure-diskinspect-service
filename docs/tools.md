## Tooling

### Parse manifests
*[[parse_manifest.py](../tools/parse_manifest.py)]*
This Python script is designed to generate two markdown files documenting the manifests content of this repo:
* [Manifest content by manifest name](manifest_content.md)
* [Manifest content by collected file](manifest_by_file.md)

Each time a manifest is added or updated, the PR should include a revised version of the two files above generated by this tool.  If the PR has an updated manifest but not updated documentation, it will fail the [Manifest documentation test](tests.md#Manifest-documentation-test).
